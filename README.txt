DEPENDENCIES

The following libraries have been used for building this player and are required
when installing:

    - Game_Music_Emu (GME): https://bitbucket.org/mpyne/game-music-emu/wiki/Home
    - Qt5 (base, gui, widgets): https://www.qt.io/
    - SDL2: https://www.libsdl.org

Assuming you are in a debian-based distribution, required libs can be installed
with the following command:

    sudo apt install qtbase5-dev libsdl2-dev libfmt-dev libsdbus-c++-dev

For other distributions the specific names of the package may vary.

Also, make sure to check this repository's submodules:

    git submodule update --init --recursive

COMPILING AND INSTALLING

Once the dependencies above have been installed, the project can simply be
built using CMake:

    cmake . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    make -C build
    make -C build install # currently may not work

The commands should be run under the project's root directory. For cmake:

    - -B specifies the directory to put the build files
    - -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release specifies to build in release mode
    - -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-mwindows" should be added in case you are doing a
      windows build: it will cause not to spanw a useless cmd window when
      running the program

When running CMake, you can also choose what interface to compile using
-DGMP_INTERFACE=[interfacename]. [interfacename] can be:

    - qt: the default interface. The program will use a full GUI interface that
      should be fully cross-platform.
    - console: a more minimal interface, intended for console/terminal/headless
      interfaces. It probably won't work on non-linux OSes.

You can also choose to build with or without MPRIS support by passing
-DBUILD_MPRIS=ON or OFF.

For make, -C specifies the directory where to find the Makefile.
When compilation is completed, the executable should be found inside build/.

WINDOWS

On Windows, you must install both conan and Qt already. You should install Qt
through the online installer.
When everything is installed, issue the following commands on the project root:

    set QT_DIR=/path/to/qt
    conan install . --output-folder=build --build=missing
    cd build
    cmake .. -DGMP_INTERFACE=qt -DBUILD_MPRIS=OFF -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=conan_toolchain.cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=%QT_DIR%
    cmake --build . --config Release
    cmake --install .

Where:

    - /path/to/qt is where your Qt installation is located. Note that it's not
      enough to specify C:\Qt here; for example, if you've got an installation
      with Qt 6.6.1 and MSVC 2019, you should specify C:\Qt\6.6.1\msvc2019_64
    - conan will install the needed libraries (zlib, sdl, fmt) inside the build/
      directory
    - The CMake command specifies the Qt interface and turns off MPRIS support
    - The second CMake command specifies to build in Release mode
    - In the third CMake command you may specify a directory to install to by
      using --prefix <dir>
